# Book-Recommendation-System-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
Final year dissertation project

This project was carried out as an Honors Dissertation project at Heriot-Watt University, Dubai. For this, we successfully developed 4 models for a Book Recommendation System and carried out objective and subjective testing to evaluate the model performances. User-testing was carried out the subjective testing of the implemented models.

**Models Implemented:-**
1. Content-based
2. Collaborative-filtering
3. Cascade Hybrid
4. Weighted Hybrid

The datasets used for the development were the **Book-crossing** and **Goodreads-10k** datasets which have been added to the Datasets folder.
